# Price Prediction App | Streamlit Interface

Welcome to the repository for the **Bitcoin Price Predictor Web App**, developed as part of my Final Year Project.
*A project focused on predicting accurate prices using ML regression models and an interactive Streamlit interface.*

---

## Overview

**Bitcoin Price Predictor Application** is a user-friendly web application that utilizes Machine Learning techniques to estimate Bitcoin prices based on historical and feature-based data.

It supports:

* Real-time prediction
* Model performance visualization
* Scalable deployment

To design and implement this tool:

* Accurately predicts prices using ML models and users to make their data driven decisions accurately
* Provides a smooth user experience through a clean UI

## Repositry Content

The repositry structure as follows:
 - `.idea` – Project configuration files created by PyCharm (not required for execution or deployment).
 - `venv` – Virtual environment containing project-specific dependencies (should be excluded from GitHub using .gitignore).
 - `.gitignore file` – Specifies files/folders Git should ignore (e.g., venv/, .idea/, __pycache__/).
 - `code.py file` – Main Python script that implements Bitcoin price prediction using machine learning models.
 - `README.md file` – Provides an overview, setup guide, and usage instructions for the project.
